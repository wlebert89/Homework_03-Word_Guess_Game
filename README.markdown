This is a word guessing game project that I coded using html, css, and javascript.

I created my own background image in 3D using Cinema 4d, Octane render, and Adobe After Effects.

This was the first web development project that I was able to create my own asset for, and I hope to keep designing assets for all of my future web and app projects.

As far as the game experience goes, I would like to figure out a way for the user to see the completed word before it cycles to the next randomly generated word. I would also like to make the game layout responsive.
